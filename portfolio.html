                                <p>Our first course—following the introductory week—was about the basic components of
                                    coding a website from scratch. This saw us setting up all the necessary software,
                                    preparing a domain for us to host our assignments on, and coding our first real
                                    website.</p>
                                <p>I had dabbled in programming languages before, so to me this served as a healthy
                                    refresher. I tuned into the mechanics of coding quickly once I got started.</p>

                            <h3>HTML & CSS</h3>
                            <p>The programming languages we worked with during this course were html and css. We started
                                out learning the very bare bones of how to plug content into a page by doing small
                                exercises with pure html.</p>
                            <p>Moving on to css, we learned how to style our pages with colours and fonts to inject our
                                personal touch. The focus was mostly on learning the basic syntax of each programming
                                language, and how they communicated with each other.</p>
                            <p>All this was leading up to our assignment, which was to be our course entry test.
                                Continuing this program was conditional on our passing the entry exam, and we were free
                                to style the website however we liked provided we followed the required layout
                                guidelines and included the content provided for the assignment.</p>

                                <p>To enhance our understanding of how the html hierarchy worked, we were taught about
                                    layout diagrams, which were also provided to us as a guideline for setting up the
                                    html
                                    structure for our assignment. The layout diagram simply shows the box-within-a-box
                                    structure that html functions by.</p>

                                <p>To set up our webpage layout we were taught the basics of css grid, with exercises to
                                    train our understanding and learn how to place objects on a page.</p>

                            <p>In the end I finished up my page fast, as I quickly got the hang of it once I dusted off
                                my old coding knowledge. This gave me the privilege of extra time to finetune my page
                                until I was pleased, and also allowed me to help my classmates troubleshoot their coding
                                errors, which was a great personal learning experience. As far as my first real
                                website goes, I was happy with the final result.</p>

                                <p>The next course was focused around the object of gathering data about prospective
                                    users and implementing it in the
                                    design process. We were taught to put ourselves in the place of our user audience,
                                    so we could get specific and
                                    conscious about our design choices.</p>
                                <p>Through this course I have learned to approach the design process from the
                                    perspective of the user rather than personal
                                    preference. It has given me tools to flesh out more user-friendly designs.</p>

                            <p>Before we could begin designing a page, we had to choose the subject of our page's
                                content and do some research. For my
                                project, I decided to make a website for houseplant enthusiasts.</p>
                            <p>The purpose of
                                research is to learn about the target audience and dispel assumptions in favour of
                                collected data. My primary method was desk research, because there
                                were plenty of online resources on my subject. I didn't conduct a formal
                                interview, but I did speak to a couple plant lovers in my social circle to get
                                an idea of what needs my plant website needed to cover.</p>

                            <h3>Design Principles</h3>
                            <p>We were taught about the Gestalt Principles of Design, which determines what makes
                                good design based on a collection of observations on human visual perception. These
                                include things like closure, proximity, continuation, and symmetry.</p>

                            <p>This course was our first introduction to Figma, which we used to create styletile and
                                prototype. I put together a
                                styletile fairly quickly as I was already decided on a visual aesthetic for my webpage.
                                I collected fonts, colour
                                palettes, and images with my chosen design keywords in mind.</p>

                            <p>The last step in the design process before coding was to create wireframes and
                                prototypes for the page. This was
                                done in several steps, from sketch on paper to a detailed interactive prototype made in
                                Figma.</p>
                            <p>We were taught different methods of brainstorming layout designs to get the
                                process started—such as crazy 8s, which I myself used to get ideas for the different
                                pages in my site. In the end I could pick out the designs I liked most and create a
                                finalised layout based on a combination of ideas.</p>

                                <p>Then we moved on to the user tests, which would determine if we had achieved what we
                                    had
                                    set out to accomplish with our
                                    page. Several different testing methods were introduced to us, and I used two; the 5
                                    second test and the think-aloud
                                    test.</p>
                                <p>I tested first on three different individuals, one of whom was not my target
                                    audience,
                                    and mostly my results were
                                    positive as they all described the page as clean and minimalistic, which was my
                                    intention. The feedback I received for
                                    aspects of improvements were all notes I had made to myself as well, which told me
                                    that
                                    my intuition about the site was
                                    correct.</p>

                                <p>I must admit, I struggled a bit with this course as I found many of the exercises
                                    repetitive, and I've found that I
                                    prefer designing during the coding process rather than sketching out plans
                                    beforehand.
                                    But I learned many techniques and methods for developing a design that keeps in mind
                                    the
                                    end user, and that is valuable. I have a more varied arsenal of tools now, and am
                                    equipped to design for future potential clients.</p>

                            <p>Unfortunately I was not feeling well towards the end of this course, and so I didn't
                                prepare
                                nor partake in the presentation. However, I got to practise this skill on course #5 when
                                my
                                group and I had to pitch our project together.</p>

                            <p>Next up was our animation course, which saw us learning javascript through the
                                process of designing and coding our own game. This was a fun endeavour, in which I
                                personally had great enjoyment designing the game mechanics, graphics, and final
                                website.</p>

                                <p>I was excited for this project as I had based the game mechanics on a
                                    storyline from a personal project, a fantasy book series I am writing. As I am a
                                    massive
                                    fan of video games and a digital artist in my leisure time, I had fun designing the
                                    gameplay to incorporate story elements of my book and draw the characters in Adobe
                                    Photoshop and Illustrator.
                                </p>
                                <p>In the end my style and colour palette for the background was heavily
                                    inspired by the game Journey, and although the characters were more anime-like in
                                    their
                                    design I am satisfied that I still managed to achieve a cohesive visual aesthetic.

                            <p>The first step in our process was concept development. We were given
                                specific requirements for gameplay mechanics we couldn’t deviate from, so I
                                determined to be as creative within the scope of my limitations as possible. I
                                fleshed out complex gameplay that made use of the required mechanics in unique ways,
                                mixing different win and lose conditions to make each game session fresh.</p>

                                <p>Thus I set to work on the graphics. I sketched out my character and game elements in
                                    Adobe Photoshop with my Wacom graphic tablet. The background and UI elements were
                                    sketched traditionally, with pen on paper. I then transferred the sketches to
                                    Illustrator and began bringing my characters to life.</p>

                            <p>Coding the game was both fun and a challenge. I had attempted to learn javascript
                                many years ago when I'd first gotten into html and css, but never fully understood
                                it until this project.</p>
                            <p>It was satisfying seeing my game start to function the way I'd intended it, and I enjoyed
                                playing around with conditions and functions to get the exact layer of complexity I
                                desired. The last day of the assignment I spent tweaking all the finer details to give
                                the game a professional and polished finish.</p>
                            <p>A UML and SM diagram was created to establish the flow of my game, both from the player's
                                perspective and for how the javascript would function in the backend.</p>

                                    the components of javascript we were meant to incorporate in our larger assignment.

                                    involved

                            <p>This was our first proper collaborative project, and we were split into groups of four
                                members each. The main assignment was a website designed for a real
                                client, and as such we had to find a professional business to work with us on this
                                project.</p>
                            <p>This was an interesting experience, as it was the first assignment that truly felt like a
                                taste of what it would be like to work professionally within this field, having to
                                colleborate with other professionals and work together to bring a vision to life for a
                                client.</p>

                            <p>The first week of this course was focused on exercising the skill of going out into
                                the
                                field to gather content, and we
                                were tasked with interviewing and shooting a video of a person with a passion. We
                                learned about different technical
                                equipment that we could access via KEA and use for our film, as well as interview
                                techniques to use for filming.</p>
                            <p>Working in pairs, my partner and I came up with questions and decided on a person
                                to interview. My partner knew a
                                dancer who led a kpop dance group in the city, and we went to talk to him. He was an
                                energetic personality and provided
                                good takes for our respective videos--and the interview was quick as well, which
                                made
                                the later editing stage much easier.</p>
                            <p>This was also our first foray into github, which we would come to use a lot in the
                                next
                                assignment.</p>

                            <p>We had to edit the video ourselves in Adobe Premiere Pro. This proved problematic for me,
                                as my laptop didn't possess the hardware needed to run such a demanding application. I
                                was lucky to be able to borrow a laptop over the weekend so I could get the editing
                                done. I had some experience editing videos before, and due to the interview
                                being short, it was a quick job. This was fortunate as I was challenged for time due to
                                the technical issues of my laptop.</p>
                            <p>Using editing techniques taught in class, I cut out all redundancies to make the
                                video concise and focused. I also cut the interview questions as the answers would
                                speak for themselves, and rearranged clips to create an organic flow. Then plugging in
                                B-roll where appropriate, I finished out with colour grading and background music.
                                Despite time constraints and technical issues, I am pleased with the result.
                            </p>
                            <p>Once finished, I coded a site for the video to be hosted on with a design that matched
                                the aesthetics of the video in terms of colour scheme and subject matter. I decided to
                                go with bold and bright accent colours laid over top of a dark background, to give off
                                the feeling of a spotlit stage a dancer would perform on.</p>

                            <h3>Choice of Client</h3>
                            <p>We agreed on a client quickly in our group. One of my teammates worked for a business run
                                by a professional, who was
                                sorely in need of a refresh to his website. We ended up working with Aria, a company
                                owned by voice and breathing coach
                                Jon Hollesen, who has many big companies in his resume.</p>
                            <p>My team was incredibly fortunate that Jon himself was enthusiastic and invested in our
                                project, which made working with
                                him a breeze.</p>

                            <h3>Research & Design</h3>
                            <p>This course was about content, but every step of what we had been taught on previous
                                courses was incorporated with the aim to create a final product for a real client.</p>
                            <p>We begun by looking at the client's current website to determine what could be improved.
                                This involved creating a styletile and sitemap of the current site. We also conducted an
                                interview with the client to hear in his own words what needs he had for his website,
                                and who his target audience was.
                            </p>
                            <p>In the end we decided to start from scratch. Our research and design process had all team
                                members involved; we created a Figjam board to collect our ideas, and drew up wireframes
                                in Figma together. We also created a rough sitemap and user stories based on the data we
                                had collected through our interview with the client.</p>

                                <p>Now was the time to make use of what we learned in the first week of the course. The
                                    task of video editing was delegated to one teammate, but we were all involved in the
                                    creation of photo material.</p>
                                <p>We arranged with our client for a photoshoot at KEA, where we could set up
                                    professional
                                    lighting, and also went out with the client to get footage of him working in the
                                    field.
                                    Despite technical issues, we ended up with numerous photos and two video interviews
                                    to
                                    put on our site.</p>

                            <h3>Collaborative Coding</h3>
                            <p>Another of my teammates and I were the ones primarily coding the website, whilst the
                                other two took care of content and
                                graphics. This was a great learning experience, as coding in a vacuum you can tend to
                                lean into your comfort zone.</p>
                            <p>We used github to collaborate on the files. In order for the process to run as smoothly
                                as possible, my teammate and I
                                agreed early on to be diligent with communication, so we wouldn't run into any conflicts
                                with github nor amongst
                                ourselves. We also organised our files neatly and left comments in the code, so we could
                                understand what changes had
                                been made.</p>

                            <p>We did tests of the client's current site and our redesign, primarily using the BERT
                                method and a 5 second test. The results of the old site showed the opposite of
                                what the client was hoping to communicate with his business: amateur, disorganised,
                                outdated. After our redesign, we were pleased to see that we hit our target keywords.

                            <p>Finally, we made a powerpoint for our pitch and delegated topics amongst each other. In
                                class we were advised to use the pecha kucha method of presenting, but we ended up
                                talking too long which we received feedback on. We might have been more efficient in our
                                presentation if we had practised our talking points more beforehand.</p>

                            <p>I am very thankful for my group, as they made this a smooth and enjoyable
                                experience from beginning to end. I feel fortunate to have been part of a group so
                                harmonious; it's normal to disagree, but the excellent communication between us made
                                this project fun and allowed us to challenge ourselves and each other in unique ways. I
                                can only hope my future colleagues will be as pleasant and professional.</p>
